<h3><a name="28"></a>Eric Lindley, "In the next 10 minutes"</h3>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>The piece consists of written instructions that a viewer can follow at any time and place through the duration of the concert. Alternately, the viewer may instead merely consider the piece as a possibility they could potentially follow through on.</p>
<p>The piece itself, if performed, requires a certain degree of empathy and reflexivity concerning one's own communicative gestures, and the gestures of others. It asks participants to consider the productive ambiguities of physical language, and engage with a sense of the body as a modular, even fungible vector of language.</p>

<p><b></b>Open your mind and your throttle as we recreate an extraterrestrial event that changed the course of American history: the true story of the night Ronald Reagan encountered a UFO on Mullholland Drive, and the telepathic message it delivered him. While the exact coordinates of this encounter are unconfirmed, road concert participants are encouraged to stop and perform their own historical reenactment of the blessed event at any spot along Mullholland hospitable to space ship parking.</p>

<h3><a name="68"></a>Albert Ortega, Robbie Hansen and Aaron Spafford (Vitamin Wig C), "Pointing Sticks At Cars" (online / CD)</h3>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>'Pointing Sticks At Cars' is an original recording from 2005 by Robbie Hansen, Aaron Spafford and Albert Ortega. At the time, Vitamin Wig C was an unrealized entity that encouraged walking concerts, getting outside and other things that not only maximized the d&eacute;riving experience, but that could also produce wonderful sounds for our respective recording devices. On other occasions, the Vitamin Wig C peoples would gather in a studio or a home and make strange noises with their mouths and bodies for hours on end. Often times Robbie would "soundtrack" these activities by flopping his hands about on the keys of a Lowry organ (for the sake of "naughty virtuosity"). The consensus of the group often has shifted from messing with literal meaning and musical modalities, to the Flows N Yo's of tonal meaning and vocal prosody.</p>
<p>For 'Pointing Sticks At Cars', Robbie, Albert and Aaron propped themselves up on a little hill alongside McBean Prkway. There they played in the foliage and made hyperbolic mouth sounds and pointed sticks at the vehicular passer-byers on Mcbean Prkway.</p>
<p>Enjoy the documentation! But more importantly, try it out for yourself! Its fun!</p>

<h3>Anthony Moses Sanchez, "Gay Maps"</h3>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>High above the city of Los Angeles is the Mullholland Drive where you can wind along the Hollywood Hills and see down onto the city&rsquo;s many lights. Up here are the trees, breezes, and movie stars that have captured the imagination of the world. What&rsquo;s remained in the underground and in whispers are the lives of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people who were also part of this city full of glitter and spotlights.</p>
<p>These maps are meant to direct you to locations, mostly gone and replaced, of this mythic time in Los Angeles. They are not a definitive map and their accuracy will at times be questionable since some of the history of the LGBT people were not documented plus we rely on oral histories which can be questionable under particular sets of critical eyes. This map will presume a few things.</p>
<p>1. That you are familiar with some of the major events and names of historical figures in United States LGBT history, such as the Stonewall Riots or Harry Hay.</p>
<p>2. That you have an understanding of the rich and diverse lives of LGBT people.</p>
<p>3. That going on a self-guided tour of Los Angeles with this map will be the gayest thing you&rsquo;ll ever do in life.</p>

<h3>Liz Toonkel, "Someone Like You"</h3>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>For 6 months, Liz made a recording every time she heard Adele's song Someone Like You in her daily life. She was interested to see what meaning the song could take on because she was in a healthy relationship and felt no connection to it. Over the course of the recording process said relationship fell apart but the song played on. By recording the song within its environmental context, new meaning and personalization were created through repetition, combating the obsolescence typically acquired through continuous radio airtime.</p>

<h3><a name="89"></a>Zen Dochterman, "Mulholland's Aqueduct Dreams of Salmon and Dynamite"</h3>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p>I propose to install several poems at the corner of Cahuenga and Mulholland that will take the form of dialogues between William Mulholland, the ghosts of Owens Valley, pre-1848 Mexican inhabitants of LA and the indigenous Tong-Va. These poems will allegorize the competing visions of Los Angeles propounded by these various groups.</p>
<p>The meeting of Mulholland and Cahuenga streets symbolizes a clash of several worlds in the fight over LA's destiny.</p>
<p>Mulholland, after whom the street was named, was a self-proclaimed Moses who would lead water from the Owens Valley on an exodus of more than 200 miles to our city via the massive aqueduct projects of the 1920's. Resistance to the project was fierce in Owens Valley, resulting in repeated dynamiting of the aqueduct itself and the seizure of the aqueduct by local residents in 1924.</p>
<p>Likewise the name "Cahuenga" designates an old Tong-Va town (literally Mountain-Place) and the Campo de Cahuenga in present day Studio City is the site of the Mexican surrender during the Mexican-American War, a prelude for the capture of the State by American forces in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo a year later.</p>
<p>These poems will develop an asynchronic dialogue between the conflicting desires and hopes of each group and reveal points of conflict and violence that undergird our own contemporary experience of the city.</p>

<h3><a name="15"></a>Christy Roberts, "Rode Concert"</h3>
<p><b><b>1:00 PM to 2:15 PM and 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM</b></b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p>"Rode Concert" explores private, solitary or intimate moments through the context of the public audience. As passengers are picked up and shuttled along Mulholland Drive, the driver will reenact cinematic car-singing, a device meant to humanize the character's arc through a voyeuristic gaze into a relatable situation. Allowing the act to be shared in the physical, without the separation of film or television straddles the line between trope and vulnerability, familiarity and chance.</p>
<p>Rides will begin at 1PM at 6713 Mulholland Drive and will drop off and pick up parties from one to four people between 6713 Mulholland Drive and 17185 Mulholland Drive from 1PM - 2:15PM and 3PM - 4:30PM.</p>

<p>Chronicling my journey to Mulholland Drive from West LA through photos based on a random score derived from Situationist theory.

<p><b>All Day</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p>Yesterday my car battery died because I was listening to a cd on the stereo when the car wasn't running. I recently bought this 2003 saturn station wagon used on craigslist, the main selling point being its built in dvd player and retractable screen in the back seat. Right after I bought the car I tested the dvd player out with my copy of Mulholland Dr. It didn't work and just ate the disc!</p>
<p>Anyway, yesterday after I jumpstarted the car the dvd player miraculously started working, but the eject button still doesn't, so I'm left with a permanent Mulholland Dr. player on wheels. Soon after I made this discovery my girlfriend Susanna Battin informed me about the Mulholland D&eacute;rive event - We propose to operate the Mulholland Dr. Player on Wheels as a free taxi service for travelers along the route from 3pm to 6pm tomorrow.</p>

<p>Idea Truck is a converted food truck that will meander along Mulholland Drive dishing out IDEAS: Half-Baked Ideas, Worst Nightmares, Creepy Critters and Other Crawlies&hellip;</p>
<p>In order to buy an idea off the menu, you have to pay with your own idea. No currency, just write an idea. Half price if you recite your idea out loud with an accent...We&rsquo;ll even ring the dinner bell.</p>
<p>Once your order is up, the new idea is yours to do with as you like, unless you want to invoke our return policy. Or discuss it with the writer, for on your hand-written idea will be the email of its original creator. Be sure to order on Two for Tuesdays--two ideas for the price of one. And don&rsquo;t forget to ask about the secret menu.</p>

<p><b>All Day</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p>For the Los Angeles Road Concerts: Mulholland D&eacute;rive on December 9, 2012 I would like to install a number of figurative lawn signs along the length of the route of the d&eacute;rive both stuck into the ground and zip-tied to fences. These yard signs are made from plastic repurposed from advertising fence signs found throughout Los Angeles. The signs have been reshaped into the forms of various desert animals and dancing hippie women. The forms were inspired by a scene in the novel Blood Meridian where these specific desert animals gather around a flaming, lightning-struck stump under the Pleiades constellation. In addition, battery powered LED light eyes have been added to the signs to mimic reflecting animal eyes at night and the Pleiades constellation itself. This project seeks to explore the idea of seeing and being seen while participating in an event that may be alchemic or magical. The project will also call attention to the staggering amount of plastic signs that adorn almost every fence and freeway exit in Los Angeles, but may not be seen as frequently on Mulholland Boulevard.</p>

<h3><a name="54"></a>Margie Schnibbe, "Hitchhiker"</h3>
<p><b>All Day</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p>On December 9th I will hitchhike along Mulholland Drive starting at noon and continuing until the sun sets at 4:44 pm. My journey will begin at Cahuenga Blvd. and continue westward as far as I can go within the allotted time period. Along the way I will make multiple stops engaging with people on and off the road. Perhaps I will shoot photos/video and/or record ambient sound. If I reach the western border prior to sunset I will double back and repeat the trip until the daylight ends.</p>
<p>When I was teenager my friends and I used to hitchhike for fun while stoned on pot or tripping on acid. When I was eighteen I hitchhiked alone from New Orleans to Tampa, a total of six hundred and fifty-seven miles. This past New Year&rsquo;s Eve I was trapped on the Valley side of Laurel Canyon and had to bum a ride across Mulholland Drive in order to get myself back to my home east of Hollywood.</p>
<p>My hitchhiking performance will serve as a social experiment and an exploration of risking taking and trust in a simultaneously public and private space. Is the act of hitching a ride with a stranger a deviant and dangerous display of nostalgia? Or is hitchhiking a contemporary and sustainable mode of urban transport?</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting you on the road.</p>

<h3><a name="73"></a>Social Humanistic ART</h3>
<p><b>All Day</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p>Nicholas Smith's recently formed creative collective known as Social Humanistic ART, or S.H.ART for short, is proudly bringing the urban to the suburban in the Mulholland D&eacute;rive Los Angeles Road Concerts. Mulholland Drive is known for its school yards, churches, hillside views, and security gates. However, many Angelenos are more familiar with bad traffic, cockroaches, street meat shopping cart cookers, and strip malls. Experiencing these inner city idiosyncrasies leave a joyful mark on a person, and I don't want to disenfranchise the suburban neighborhoods of Mulholland Drive from those same experiences. On December 9th, 2012, keep your eyes open for small sculptures that I will be ornamenting Mulholland Drive with in order to make the roadway more urban. Feel free to take them if you wish after they have dried.</p>

<p>AwareWalk/2012 is a walk-a-thon benefiting the Foundation for Awarenessness. Departing from the Hollywood Bowl Overlook at noon, participant(s) brave speeding cars, rough terrain and the unforgiving elements as they venture west along the winding, hilly and often shoulder-less Mulholland Drive. The route crosses the 405 freeway (over the Carmageddon II bridge) and ends where Mulholland becomes a footpath, near the entrance of the LA-96 Nike Missile Site. Sign a liability waiver, receive your bib number, and walk with us for a portion of the route or the entire way! (Visit <a href="awarenessness.org">awarenessness.org</a> for more details.) Also, be sure to follow live text and photo updates on Twitter (@Awarenessness) and Facebook (<a href="facebook.com/awarenessness">facebook.com/awarenessness</a>). Finally, the public is invited to celebrate with us at the finish line with free healthy snacks and refreshments&mdash;tentatively 5:00pm or whenever the walker(s) complete the nearly 14-mile route.</p>

<p class="indented"></p>
<p>I was chosen for a commission by the city of Santa Monica to create a public art installation in Santa Monica&rsquo;s Clover Park. As I walked the site, I thought about how a park&rsquo;s structure describes the value system and self-perception of the society that constructed it. For instance, France&rsquo;s gardens of Versailles communicate that Louis XIV, the &ldquo;Sun King&rdquo;, is the center of the Universe who controls all of nature, including you. I wondered &ldquo;what does this park say about us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not know the answer to this question, but the Sun King would consider it odd how our city has sculptured a quasi-natural environment while simultaneously posting 100 signs that prohibit, organize, regulate and compartmentalize. What does this say about our relationship to nature?</p>
<p>To government? To each other?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a description of my first public art project from the Santa Monica Mirror&rsquo;s article, Fresh Art To Bloom in Clover Park1:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Happy Puddle Collective, featuring Santa Monica resident Abbie Jane Baron, has erected the Clover Park Sign Project that parodies the rules and regulations imposed upon nature and society. The mock rules include prohibiting flies and ants entry into the picnicking area, designating daydreaming zones and a squirrel registration site, along with one sign instructing park goers to do the Funky Chicken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twenty pieces of art were cut from aluminum and then coated with vinyl color and secured on wood posts as if official signage. They were installed at site-specific locations throughout the park. For instance, at the top of a knoll reads the sign, &ldquo;Roll down this hill&rdquo;. A cloud-shaped sign designates a prime nap location. A bright red sign indicates that you are entering an &ldquo;Invisible Zone&rdquo;. Another sign says to &ldquo;Sit on the Grass.&rdquo; The squirrel registration sign is adjacent to a Parks Management office. Local artist Michael Asher quips, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re trying to manage open space, you&rsquo;d want everyone to register, even the squirrels.&rdquo; He adds that, &ldquo;This installation makes important the context&hellip;it&rsquo;s about the people.&rdquo; In a nutshell, that&rsquo;s what drives my interest in public art as opposed to pure gallery work: it&rsquo;s refreshing to engage the diverse community as a whole rather than communicating with just the Art World. I&rsquo;m thankful that the Santa Monica Arts Commission provided me with this opportunity to interact with the community.</p>
<p>What can I say? I made some fresh art and I&rsquo;ve caught the public art bug.</p>

<p><b>12:00 PM to 4:00 PM</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>I propose to create a site-specific work that will use Los Angeles inspired ephemera and photographs. The ephemera I will create will mimic materials found within the city&mdash;religious pamphlets, flyers, postcards, and DIY magazines. Inside these materials, a story about the city will unfold: mass graves in Los Angeles, coyote spirits, issues of citizenship &amp; belonging, the disappearing access to public art/historical sites, murder mysteries (and mysteries in general), and other LA mythologies. Meanwhile, the photographs will inspire a moment of meditation (of stopping) amidst car culture (the continuous habits of passing by and never stopping) through landscape shots of Los Angeles. Landscape photographs will include shots collected from Downtown, San Fernando Valley, Griffith Park, the 405, and other locations&mdash; also reflecting on the expansive nature of Los Angeles. These materials will then be distributed throughout the drive on Mulholland. Viewers will be given a map of locations where materials can be viewed and collected (viewers may keep materials, give them away, or leave them at the locations&mdash;as ephemera should be handled). I hope to create about 5-6 sites that will contain materials.</p>

<h3>Zen Dochterman, "Mulholland's Aqueduct Dreams of Salmon and Dynamite"</h3>
<p><b>All Day</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p>I propose to install several poems at the corner of Cahuenga and Mulholland that will take the form of dialogues between William Mulholland, the ghosts of Owens Valley, pre-1848 Mexican inhabitants of LA and the indigenous Tong-Va. These poems will allegorize the competing visions of Los Angeles propounded by these various groups.</p>
<p>The meeting of Mulholland and Cahuenga streets symbolizes a clash of several worlds in the fight over LA's destiny.</p>
<p>Mulholland, after whom the street was named, was a self-proclaimed Moses who would lead water from the Owens Valley on an exodus of more than 200 miles to our city via the massive aqueduct projects of the 1920's. Resistance to the project was fierce in Owens Valley, resulting in repeated dynamiting of the aqueduct itself and the seizure of the aqueduct by local residents in 1924.</p>
<p>Likewise the name "Cahuenga" designates an old Tong-Va town (literally Mountain-Place) and the Campo de Cahuenga in present day Studio City is the site of the Mexican surrender during the Mexican-American War, a prelude for the capture of the State by American forces in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo a year later.</p>
<p>These poems will develop an asynchronic dialogue between the conflicting desires and hopes of each group and reveal points of conflict and violence that undergird our own contemporary experience of the city.</p>

<p>I will be installing a temporary "Classical 7-Circuit Labyrinth" off of Mulholland Drive in children's sidewalk chalk, birdseed and wildflower seeds. This will leave a minimal impact on the environment and after the installation the birds will have something to eat and in the following spring/summer there will be wildflowers in bloom where the labyrinth once was.</p>
<p>This is an exercise in sacred temporal space and is symbolically tied the beginning of Mulholland Drive at the Cahuenga Pass, and just as The Labyrinth is a replete with twists, turns and blind curves, Mulholland Drive has these in abundance as well&hellip;</p>
<p>Join me in a walking meditation on the path of changes and transitions, preparing for a world yet to come&hellip;</p>

<h3>Emma Kemp, "Endurance is a cold America"</h3>
<p><b>12:00 PM to 3:00 PM</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p>My name is Emma Kemp, I am an artist from London, U.K, currently living and studying in LA (CalArts).</p>
<p>Moving from a city like London, which facilitates a large number of residents in a dense labyrinth of cityscape, where everyone is sandwiched together in a maze of historical to contemporary architecture and where public transport / travel by foot is the most viable means of movement, Los Angeles posed a whole new methodology of navigation. Upon arrival, I immediately purchased a vehicle, feeling trapped by the sheer expanse of road between buildings. It is a strange thing, to be inhibited by space. A product of modern living, where extreme distances are no longer interrogable by foot.</p>
<p>In response to this, I got a friend to blindfold me in the back of his car and drive me 20 miles in any direction. I proceeded to walk back to my home (CalArts)((not in a saccharine, metaphorical sense - I literally do live on campus) without the use of technology. This resulted in 9 hours of walking, along railways, highways and bridges. I immediately realized how hostile an environment the city is for pedestrians; there are often stretches of road without pavement, no accommodation whatsoever for the weary walker. It is however interesting to view many of the large cement sculptures from below, walking beneath freeway ramps and support structures. Anyway, this exercise was just a shallow dip into the physical construction of the city, which is of interest to me and one of my primary reasons for moving to Los Angeles. I am excited by the possibilities of the city in conjunction with surrounding landscape and how it performs in the city, such as desert, mountain and ocean.</p>
<p>The Mullholland Derive is exciting to me on many levels. Its existence as a transitory apparition, a one day event, is hugely appealing, along with its mobility and occupation of public space - where is the space for free play? could this be it? - and its inclusiveness of the uninitiated art viewer as opposed to solely the predefined museum goer.</p>
<p>My proposal, therefore, pertains to a piece of art disguised in the cloak of political, though it isn't necessarily, although, it always could be. I plan to disseminate a text I have written, seen in full <a href="http://iceberg80gsm.tumblr.com/post/33762355774/endurance-is-a-cold-america-where-is-the-dead">here</a>, spliced up into slogans printed on bumper stickers which the artist will attach to each car embarking on the exhibition drive. I think the idea of the text literally dispersing into the city after the exhibition is exciting, and during the exhibition day, each car will have a line of the text emblazoned on its rear. The vehicle owner may not even know which slogan he is towing, but the persons in the car behind can read the text on the car in front, and so on, creating a sort of delayed reading of the text as a whole.</p>
<p>Bumper stickers are inherently politically in their conception, promoting a cause or party line, used as a form of personal, micro advertising in a car centric city. Although my text has political undertones (it is a sort of ekphrastic poem containing quotes from the final presidential debate) it is also a beautiful and confusing text, offering no opinion, no solution.</p>

<p><b></b>The first thing that most young artists think of when they think of Mulholland Drive is probably David Lynch. This includes myself. But the first thing I thought of when I thought about Mulholland D&eacute;rive was a soundtrack, for a road trip. However, I have never driven, biked, or even walked on Mulholland Drive. And I haven't seen that movie in years. And I don't know many people in Los Angeles. So I decided to record myself reading some of my more intimate poems and package them in the CD cases of some of my favorite road trip albums for strangers to get to somewhat know a stranger, in a somewhat strange way.</p>

<p><b>12:00 PM to 2:00 PM</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>This project is part of a series of works exploring the history of spiritual and occult belief in Los Angeles through the Semi-Tropic Spiritualists, an organization that created a campsite meeting place outside the city limits of Los Angeles in 1905. Spiritualism has described itself as a science, a philosophy and a religion. We are interested in this system as a model for exploring ideas of faith and skepticism, belief and charlatanism.</p>
<p>Like the original Semi-Tropic Spiritualists, for this work we have created an encampment at the city&rsquo;s edge, looking back to the historic core of Los Angeles and the sites of early spiritualist and occult activity. In this performance, the public is invited to interact with sculptural divination tools available at our site. Through methods of research, divination and intuition, lost or hidden sites of spiritualist practice will be revealed.</p>

<p><b>1:00 PM to 5:00 PM</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>Los Angeles is home to many people from diverse cultural and economic backgrounds. It is also one of the leading destinations in the world for tourists, working professionals, and other people who experience the city only as passersby. In either case, LA leaves an impression with its characteristic transience, fast-pace, distance, and disconnect.</p>
<p>"Letter to Los Angeles" brings together different groups of people inhabiting LA by asking them to compose a collectively written letter addressed to the city itself. We ask participants to slow-down and reflect on the city; recall their memories and experiences of Los Angeles no matter in which way they are a part of it or not. The eventual coauthored letter will be a whole product composed by the many discrepant thoughts, criticisms, comments, and other ideas about life in LA. Its fragmented and eclectic style, we believe, will effectively capture the feeling of the city.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Bowl Overlook provides participants with a vast view of the city. As the most eastern of the Conservancy's scenic overlooks, the Hollywood Bowl Overlook faces the Hollywood Bowl Amphitheater, downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood Sign, and Griffith Park Observatory.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not hanging noodles on your ears (Russian) &ndash; I&rsquo;m not joking</p>
<p>Cleaner than a frog&rsquo;s armpit (Spanish) &ndash; to be poor</p>
<p>Idioms are a peculiar form of non-literal language that can spark your imagination and tap into the illogical functions of your brain. These cryptic language puzzles are solvable only if you already know the answer in advance. Idiomatic expressions are odd, but far from the periphery of language. People everywhere on earth express themselves this way&mdash;they are central to how we communicate. Based on his research, linguist Steven Pinker believes that we have as many idioms in our long-term memory as we have words.</p>
<p>Because of our brain's proclivity for remembering Idioms, they have become widely popular among advice columnists and self-help gurus. Often times bad news is met with, "Every Cloud has a Silver Lining," and a recent break-up victim is told, "There are other Fish in the Sea."</p>
<p>MUC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Idiomatic Road Interventions,&rdquo; likens the twists and turns of LA&rsquo;s Mulholland Drive to the unexpected and sudden turns of meaning in idiomatic phrases. Keep an eye out for idiom banner interventions on the roadside, the hillside, and in the treetops as you traverse this historical urban-rural cruising derive. You&rsquo;ll find short spurts of humor, inspiration, and other oddities just around the bend!</p>

<p class="indented"></p>
<p>About "Immersion Pyramid" by Mookyung Sohn: <br />Immersion Pyramid invites visitors inside a triangular structure. Pyramids have historically provided ideal spaces for focusing and amplifying energy. In pyramids, one can harness inner powers to invoke our hidden capacities. Inspired by meditation pyramids of the 60s and 70s, the intention is to provide a structure for visitors to immerse themselves in: a space for invocation, aspiration, and mediation to take place that allows spiritual energies to be activated and quantified. BYOR (Bringing Your Own Ritual) and sitting in the center of the pyramidal structure is strongly encouraged as well as partaking in a collective experience ( preferably with the serendipitously encountered stranger near you).</p>
<p>Mookyung Sohn is an artist working in various media including drawing, digital media, and textile design. A bird and sun lover interested in mind-manifesting and transcendence, she currently lives and works in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>About Nu Speed: <br />Seeking to expose hidden realms, illicit transcendence and dark truths, Nu Speed is an artist working in various media. With an interest in anagrams, puns, fractals, Nu Speed's video projections reveal a gravitation towards lenticular photographs, leaving traces of transdimensional space ghosts in their path. The eerie drone of her soundtracks evokes hypnotic chase scenes, while her literary pieces lend clever sexual advisement to her readers and nearly 13,000 Facebook fans under the alias Vitus Hearn. Working to synthesize a host of talents, Nu Speed is working on a video-narrative to unite her extrasolar media projects.</p>
<p>About We Open Art Houses (WOAH): <br />We Open Art Houses (WOAH) is an emerging arts-service organization based in Los Angeles. Working in tandem with property owners to reimagine empty space as a site for temporary art venues, WOAH aims to bring unique site-specific projects and arts education programming to a diversified public sphere.

<p>metaphysically the work consists of a number of different conundrums through which the audience, should they so choose, must navigate to reach a sense of experience/existence. these conundrums are ultimately "framed" by the most readily readable question "when is propaganda beautiful?" initially, that inquisition seems innocuous but its malignancy, controversy, is amplified with intimacy.</p>

<p>No Strings Attached Dancers will be performing a performance combining action-painting and dance in collaboration with Los Angeles-based visual artist Michael Lightsey. They will also be collaborating with musical group the Dirty Chaps in creating a new contemporary piece choreographed live at the Mullholland Drive experience.</p>
<p>ABOUT NO STRINGS ATTACHED DANCE COMPANY</p>
<p>Rooted in the belief that collaboration evokes strong creations, the company makes new statements about the poetic world by linking theater, music, and the visual arts. Using classically trained dancers, they create new works that cultivate and evolve the language of contemporary movement. Since its inception in 2011, the group quickly built collaborative relationships with such innovative choreographers as Kathryn Roszak, Alan Scofield, Adelle Binelli, acclaimed violin duo DoubleTake, Southern California soprano Leah Klaver, Lightsey Fine Arts, and a variety of Southern California visual artists and galleries. No Strings Attached strives to become the moving art of the artist's vast canvas of life.</p>

<h3>Skip Snow + Frau Kolb + Todd Gray, "Exchange"</h3>
<p><b>2:00 PM to 4:00 PM</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>Exchange invites members of the community to accept a painting by Skip Snow in exchange for information about themselves and their relationship to the art community. The participants will also be required to have their portrait taken by a photographer from the Los Angeles arts community, and fill out a questionnaire about their relationship to the art world in &lsquo;exchange&rsquo; for a painting by Skip Snow from his studio practice.</p>
<p>Having completed one out of six instances of the project, It becomes clear that the relative value of the paintings contrasted with the fairly trivial value of the information exchanged, creates a social enviornment, in which participants are forced to question the value of an art work, outside of its normal context such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial galleries</li>
<li>Museums,</li>
<li>University galleries</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants are confronted with a demand to aesthetically evaluate a traditional studio paintings by an artist, Skip Snow, without the force of the market to rank that painting of the participant. They can choose to ignore the event, evaluate the works, and if they wish get a painting for free in exchange for their participation in what they easily imagine to be a future re-evaluation of the work, and the project in a more traditional art world setting.</p>
<p>Interactions of duologue about the value of an artist's labor, the power of art world hierarchy, and the manner of cultural accession create an environment which allows the fetishism of the market to be replaced by the fetishism of 'the good story' on how an artist give work to the public as a way to join the art community without the permission, or blessing of the market.</p>
<p>The portraits created become a new form of property, the reproductions of the work given away become more material manifestation of the work, and thus become an interesting artifact in their own right.</p>
<p>Artist Biographies:</p>
<p>Skip Snow, a participant of the East Village Art movement 1989- 1994 has exhibited nationally and internationally in solo and group exhibitions including MOMA&rsquo;s PS 1, The Aldridge Museum, The Patterson Museum of Art, The Brooklyn Armory, The New Math Gallery, Club 57, The Sharpe Gallery, The Alexander Wood Gallery, and Fashion Moda. He suspended his public participation in the art world from 1990, until now. Skip Snow received his undergraduate education at NYU&rsquo;s Experimental Theatre wing, and worked as a performer and technician with Sky Saver Productions and The Wooster group.</p>
<p>Todd Gray received his BFA and MFA from California Institute of the Arts, Gray is currently a Professor of Art at California State University, Long Beach. Gray has performed at REDCAT (Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater), New York University, University of Houston, Syracuse University and the Kunsthochschule fur Medien, Koln, Germany. He has exhibited his photo-based work internationally and is represented in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Canada; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; MOCA, Los Angeles; University of Parma, Italy and other collections.</p>
<p>Frau Kolb is an artist, primarily a painter, whose interest in art history (in which she has a B.A. from Columbia University 2001) and contemporary art have led her to focus on the dazzling work of her fellow audio, visual, and performing artists. In 2010, during her epic tango with breast cancer, the artist began performance painting in collaboration with musicians, after nearly a decade of producing abstract paintings; she became interested in time based mediums including art-noise performance. Frau Kolb made her first performance art video at Art Haus, a pop-up artists' collective led by, Topanga legend, artist James Mathers. She has participated in group exhibitions in Los Angeles, Berkley UC Davis, and New York City beginning in 2010 and as recently as 2012. The alternative art-news web-site www.talkinggrid.com is her brainchild.</p>

<h3>MUC Collaborative, "Idiomatic Road Interventions"</h3>
<p><b>1:00 PM to 3:00 PM</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b> <br />MUC (a collaboration between artists Christina Pierson, Vicki Tao, and Yoshie Sakai)</p>
<p>Kicked the Bucket (English) &ndash; to die</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hanging noodles on your ears (Russian) &ndash; I&rsquo;m not joking</p>
<p>Cleaner than a frog&rsquo;s armpit (Spanish) &ndash; to be poor</p>
<p>Idioms are a peculiar form of non-literal language that can spark your imagination and tap into the illogical functions of your brain. These cryptic language puzzles are solvable only if you already know the answer in advance. Idiomatic expressions are odd, but far from the periphery of language. People everywhere on earth express themselves this way&mdash;they are central to how we communicate. Based on his research, linguist Steven Pinker believes that we have as many idioms in our long-term memory as we have words.</p>
<p>Because of our brain's proclivity for remembering Idioms, they have become widely popular among advice columnists and self-help gurus. Often times bad news is met with, "Every Cloud has a Silver Lining," and a recent break-up victim is told, "There are other Fish in the Sea."</p>
<p>MUC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Idiomatic Road Interventions,&rdquo; likens the twists and turns of LA&rsquo;s Mulholland Drive to the unexpected and sudden turns of meaning in idiomatic phrases. Keep an eye out for idiom banner interventions on the roadside, the hillside, and in the treetops as you traverse this historical urban-rural cruising derive. You&rsquo;ll find short spurts of humor, inspiration, and other oddities just around the bend!</p>

<h3>Philip Mantione and Daniel Eaton, "Music for Two Cars @ Autry Overlook" and "Passersby"</h3>
<p><b>1:00 PM to 4:00 PM</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>Music for Two Cars @ Autry Overlook is a multichannel sound installation intended for playback through two car stereo systems. Mantione and Eaton created sound independently using an agreed upon structure and loosely defined textures. The dynamic spatial positioning of the cars in relation to each other and their configuration (windows, doors, trunk lids) will create ever changing sonic relationships. Listeners are encouraged to move around the space for a multifaceted experience.</p>
<p>The use of vehicles for a sound piece on Mulholland Drive is a clear reference to the transient and mobile lifestyle that defines Los Angeles. Beyond that, this project lays the groundwork for Music for XX Cars @ ??</p>
<p>A companion piece called Passersby, will document the anonymous and random comments, sounds, and/or sonic instigations of visitors. These recordings will be used for future sound works by the artists.</p>
<p>BIOS:</p>
<p>Philip Mantione has composed music for orchestra, chamber ensembles, computer, fixed media, interactive performance, multimedia installations and experimental video. He writes custom software in Max/MSP to create music that melds field recordings, sampling and computer generated sound into unique sonic textures. His Sinusoidal Tendencies, released on Innova, has been described as "austerely impressive" (Paris Transatlantic Monthly) and "a searing study in form and color." Zane Fischer, of the Santa Fe Reporter, called his interactive sound sculpture, The Human Resistor, "...a satisfying, interactive rabbit hole, in which tactility becomes sound." L.P. Streitfeld, art critic and writer for the New York Times and The Advocate &amp; Greenwich Times, has described his collaborative work with visual artist Alysse Stepanian as "a wry and profound commentary on the conflicted state of America's emotions." Mantione&rsquo;s work has been presented at notable venues such as the Bing Theater at LACMA, Merkin Concert Hall (NYC), Baltimore Contemporary Art Museum, Islip Art Museum, CCA (Santa Fe,NM), SESI' Cultural Centre (Brazil), CCCB (Barcelona, Spain), National Museum of Fine Arts (Cuba), and the European Media Arts Festival (Germany). Recent concerts include: John Donald Robb Composers' Symposium at UNM and the Southwest Festival of New Music (New Mexico). He currently teaches Audio Technology and Production at the Art Institute of California - Inland Empire. www.philipmantione.com</p>
<p>Daniel Walter Eaton has garnered notoriety for his unique approach to scoring films and animations. Honed and trained in traditional music making, he easily slips between the worlds of wild or sometimes subtle musical experimentation and more formulaic derivative music. He believes music and sound can truly empower the moving image to unexpected heights. His work for the moving image has been featured at the 2012 Sundance Festival, the 2012 Annecy Animation Festival, and numerous other festivals through out the world. Daniel is also a performer, recording artist, and teacher currently residing in the Los Angeles area. He performs regularly as a solo artist and in the trio GRAMPUS that features percussionist/composer Mike Lockwood and trumpeter programmer Louis Lopez. In both settings Daniel explores interfacing with audio and live visual media through interface with the laptop and the open platform program Max/Msp/Jitter. He has built custom micro controllers and interfaces for his trombone and also wearable video projection gear through out the last few years. He has performed with Wadada Leo Smith, Vinny Golia, Bobby Mcferin, Cloud Eye Control, Orkestar Mezeʼ, The Open Gate Theater, and many others through out the years. He currently holds a B.M. in trombone performance from the University of Wisconsin and an M.F.A. in Composition, Experimental Sound Practices and Integrated Media from the California Institute of the Arts.</p>

<h3>Yana Tutunik, "Do I Have Something To Say"</h3>
<p><b>All Day</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>Do I have something to say? is a sculptural, semi-poetic, performance activated piece that confuses the subject/object position. Is the piece asking of itself whether it has any real meaning? Or, does it force the viewer to ask whether he or she has any substantive commentary to make? Playing with the dynamics of art viewing itself, the statement gets broken down into sub statements, questions, and pleas. Presented at 12062 Mulholland Drive, Do I have something to say? overlooks the rolling LA landscape, a puny billboard and a transitory monument to humble concerns.</p>

<p><b>All Day</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>High above the city of Los Angeles is the Mullholland Drive where you can wind along the Hollywood Hills and see down onto the city&rsquo;s many lights. Up here are the trees, breezes, and movie stars that have captured the imagination of the world. What&rsquo;s remained in the underground and in whispers are the lives of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people who were also part of this city full of glitter and spotlights.</p>
<p>These maps are meant to direct you to locations, mostly gone and replaced, of this mythic time in Los Angeles. They are not a definitive map and their accuracy will at times be questionable since some of the history of the LGBT people were not documented plus we rely on oral histories which can be questionable under particular sets of critical eyes. This map will presume a few things.</p>
<p>1. That you are familiar with some of the major events and names of historical figures in United States LGBT history, such as the Stonewall Riots or Harry Hay.</p>
<p>2. That you have an understanding of the rich and diverse lives of LGBT people.</p>
<p>3. That going on a self-guided tour of Los Angeles with this map will be the gayest thing you&rsquo;ll ever do in life.</p>

<h3>Fette Sans, "The substance of the tale is very thin"</h3>
<p><b>5:00 PM to 5:10 PM</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>Upon receiving a phone call, one of the performers would spontaneously embrace the other, and kiss passionately at length, or erupt in an increasingly loud and severe argument then slap the other. While this is taking place, I will be photographing the mise en scene as if this was all unpremeditated and I simply happen to be on location, like others informed of the event.</p>
<p>I am interested in the manipulation of fiction through verifiable images, and how the documentation of situations can also be performative. By photographing the hired actors as well the passers-by (cars and pedestrians, aware of the events, or not) I want to obscure the initial intention and question pretense - was this situation true or staged?</p>

<p><b></b>Sarah Jessica Parker Movie Star Trailer invokes the glamour and mythology surrounding the private domain of movie stars while they are on a film set. In this case the trailer is a horse trailer because Sarah Jessica Parker looks like a horse&hellip; of course.</p>
<p>By making a physical object based on an idea that exists within the public imagination, the work further entrenches this rather unfortunate comparison between the features of a well known actress and a horse.</p>

<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>Mulholland drive is known for its grand views of the landscape. Peri-Tetrascope attempts to turn that view back to the individual by placing viewers eye to eye, and directing their gaze around and onto the bodies of others.</p>
<p>The Peri-Tetrascope is a viewfinder-like apparatus for multiple visitors to observe their physical and social surroundings simultaneously. The Peri-Tetrascope consists of four toy periscopes bolted to a helmet that I will be wearing. Two periscopes in the front of the helmet allow viewers to come face to face with me, but view the landscape directly in front of them. Two periscopes toward the back of the helmet are situated so that observers standing behind me can similarly see around my head. The rear periscopes are oriented horizontally, such that if both front and rear scopes are in use, the rear observer will have a clear view of the front observer&rsquo;s gazing face.</p>
<p>I will locate myself at the Charles and Lotte Melhorn Lookout. An inviting pause for visitors, this lookout equipped with railing, a bench, and an overhang. It is a site perfectly suited for a viewfinder device.</p>

<h3>landd (Lindsay August-Salazar and Devin Kenny), "Dropped Pin"</h3>
<p><b>2:00 PM to 5:00 PM</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p>Lindsay August-Salazar (UC Irvine 13) and Devin Kenny (UCLA 13) are artists working in a variety of mediums (including painting, sound, performance, etc) and they have been developing a series of interventions in public, private, and semi-public spaces using analyses of quotidian and subcultural activities with the impetus of a connection between contemporary art practices and modern dance practices. They go by the pseudonym "landd". Using the structures created by dance theorist and practitioner Peggy Hackney, Ms. August-Salazar and Mr. Kenny have been embarking on a continued exploration of everyday actions through the lens of movement research. Peggy Hackney&rsquo;s organizational structure for the body is called the Six Patterns of Total Connectivity, and include Breath, Core-Distal (emanating from the central/navel region), Upper-Lower (a consideration of the top and bottom sections of the body, from the navel), Body Half (a consideration of the left and right sides of the body), etc. Hackney&rsquo;s work built off of Rudolf Laban and was continued through Irmgard Bartenieff, Bonnie Cohen, and host of others. The system developed by Hackney provides us a foundation upon which we can build a series of works that are located on an interdisciplinary level by:</p>
<ul>
<li>applying structures formulated for the production of dance performances to non-dance phenomena</li>
</ul>
<p><br />and a transdisciplinary level by:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>taking the result of said application of structures and presenting it in an artistic and discursive space, with an understanding of the changes that the work undergoes (from art, to academia, to entertainment/leisure, to business/productivity, etc) as a result.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>We want to focus on the issue of normative ways of movement in everyday life within and beyond disciplinary boundaries with the possibility of new perspectives. For our performance Ms. Salazar will be parking her black Prius somewhere near 13951 Mulholland Drive for approximately 15-20 minutes while I do the "a little closer...you're still far from the curb..." etc set of gestures. The result will be documented and then notated as dance, so that it may be even able to exist in contexts other than its original street location and be enacted by agents other than this specific car, and these specific persons. The event would take place Sunday at 2PM for approximately 20-30 minutes.</p>

<p class="indented"></p>
<p>The Mobile Pinhole Project is a non-profit, artist run organization that uses a roving van-turned-pinhole camera to bring photography workshops to youth in neighborhoods across Los Angeles. Our mobile vancam takes youth literally inside the camera to learn about the medium. Our mission is to make photography accessible to all youth as a tool they can apply to reframe and communicate ideas of culture, identity and place. During the Mulholland Derive, we invite all ages of participants to come inside the giant camera to experience photography and this scenic overlook from the inside-out. Our installation at Johnson Overlook, a vantage of both hillside and 405, will allow viewers to frame this freeway and tourist vantage from both inside the car and inside the camera.</p>

<h3>Jonas Becker, "Carmageddon and Other Apocalypse Shorts"</h3>
<p><b>1:00 PM to 5:00 PM</b></p>
<p>Artist Jonas Becker will be projecting previews from her upcoming video project, 2x12, a series of shorts that reflect on cultural myths about time and the End of the world. During the Mulholland Derive, the segment titled Carmageddon, will be projected onto the windshield of her van, parked at the Johnson Overlook on Mulholland Drive. Carmageddon highlights the hyperbolized analogy between closing the 405 freeway in 2011 and the end of the world, and reflects on the cultural ecosystem that birthed Carmageddon as both phenomena and anti-climax. In the videos, Becker creates her own freeway monster by montaging footage of the empty 405 shot from plane, bike and car. The segment asks: What would the End of the World be in your world? What would it look like? The installation at Johnson Overlook is intended to be a playful conversation between the 405 imagined in the video and the 405 visible from the overlook.</p>
<p>This project is generously supported by a grant from The Six Points Fellowship for Emerging Jewish Artists, a program of the Foundation for Jewish Culture, originally founded in partnership with Avoda Arts and JDub. The Six Points Fellowship LA Cohort is made possible through major funding from The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, the Jewish Community Foundation of Los Angeles, and the Righteous Persons Foundation.</p>

<h3>MUC Collaborative, "Idiomatic Road Interventions"</h3>
<p><b>All Day</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p>Kicked the Bucket (English) &ndash; to die</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hanging noodles on your ears (Russian) &ndash; I&rsquo;m not joking</p>
<p>Cleaner than a frog&rsquo;s armpit (Spanish) &ndash; to be poor</p>
<p>Idioms are a peculiar form of non-literal language that can spark your imagination and tap into the illogical functions of your brain. These cryptic language puzzles are solvable only if you already know the answer in advance. Idiomatic expressions are odd, but far from the periphery of language. People everywhere on earth express themselves this way&mdash;they are central to how we communicate. Based on his research, linguist Steven Pinker believes that we have as many idioms in our long-term memory as we have words.</p>
<p>Because of our brain's proclivity for remembering Idioms, they have become widely popular among advice columnists and self-help gurus. Often times bad news is met with, "Every Cloud has a Silver Lining," and a recent break-up victim is told, "There are other Fish in the Sea."</p>
<p>MUC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Idiomatic Road Interventions,&rdquo; likens the twists and turns of LA&rsquo;s Mulholland Drive to the unexpected and sudden turns of meaning in idiomatic phrases. Keep an eye out for idiom banner interventions on the roadside, the hillside, and in the treetops as you traverse this historical urban-rural cruising derive. You&rsquo;ll find short spurts of humor, inspiration, and other oddities just around the bend!</p>

<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>Upon receiving a phone call, one of the performers would spontaneously embrace the other, and kiss passionately at length, or erupt in an increasingly loud and severe argument then slap the other. While this is taking place, I will be photographing the mise en scene as if this was all unpremeditated and I simply happen to be on location, like others informed of the event.</p>
<p>I am interested in the manipulation of fiction through verifiable images, and how the documentation of situations can also be performative. By photographing the hired actors as well the passers-by (cars and pedestrians, aware of the events, or not) I want to obscure the initial intention and question pretense - was this situation true or staged?</p>

<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>I plan to dip three pi&ntilde;atas in white paint and stuff them with poems and cheap black pens. The pi&ntilde;atas will be held by a leash and placed in the road. A willing participant will drive down the road, at some point encountering and hitting each pi&ntilde;ata. The destroyed pi&ntilde;atas will be left on the side of the road, like road kill, for the rest of the event. Afterwards the inked poems will be removed, the collision having indeterminately edited the text.</p>

<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>The Barter Toll Station is an optional, participatory road-side booth where drivers can exchange items found in their vehicles with items already placed at the station by the artists from their cars. A Take-an-Item, Leave-an-Item toll, this project highlights drivers' personal histories through refuse, via accumulation that reflects personal distinction as well as cultural habits. These items and histories become the objects for exchange.</p>

<h3>Jason Jenn, "The Queen of the Weeds Proclamation"</h3>
<p><b>2:00 PM to 5:00 PM</b></p>
<p class="indented"></p>
<p><b></b>She is a deity/ spiritual representative of the plants that are usually looked down upon by society. We persecute and neglect the weeds, believing them to have little value in our culture and as unwanted. We spend a lot of resources seeking to destroy them or kill them if they pop up where we don't want them. She has something to say about that and will state her case for the forgotten benefits, strengths and power of the weeds. She also makes parallels of weeds to humans within the fringe/outcasts/queer culture. She will also have available materials for distribution with a few identification and facts about beneficial weeds that are native to the region for people to carry home with them.</p>
