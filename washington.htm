  <TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=top><b>Over 60 artists reinterpret public space along entirety of Wash Blvd</b><p>

WHERE: The entire length of Washington Blvd., from Whittier to Venice Beach<br>
WHEN: October 11, 2009 12PM-6PM<p>

“A Day in L.A.” shows work from over sixty Los Angeles artists and non-artists in unused public outdoor spaces along the entire length of Washington Boulevard’s 27 miles, from Whittier to Venice Beach. For one day artists will perform works, create installations, facilitate happenings, and make music in unexpected spaces, such as on the sidewalk, between dumpsters, along railroad tracks, as well as inside the audience’s cars as they traverse one of LA’s most iconic boulevards. An official map of the day’s events along with schedules and other downloadable information will be available to the public starting on October 4 on the event website (www.washblvd.tk).<p>

Works range from performances and installations to writings and discussions. The audience can choose how long they want to spend at each spot, skip spots or drive at different speeds between destinations as they traverse Wash. Blvd from Whittier to Venice Beach, culminating in an end performance at Venice Pier. Audience members are additionally invited to car pool with some artists between spots and to switch car pools at their leisure.<p>

Building on the success of their last curatorial endeavor, The San Fernando Road Concert in 2008, Los Angeles Road Concerts seeks to investigate the possibilities of Washington Blvd as a site for artistic exploration. Washington Blvd is LA’s longest east-west street and one of the longest municipal streets in the world. This event will highlight this space as a way to view how the Los Angeles metropolis grew, and the massive in-between and negative spaces it left behind as it expanded. Additionally, this day will examine the Blvd as a cross-section of the city's diversity of landscapes and people. This exhibition/event/experiment asks, “How can we generate a new kind of LA experience, bringing meaning and attention to a collection of less obvious destinations?”<p>

Participating artists include musicians, artists, writers, non-artists and residents of Washington Blvd's many neighborhoods:  Danielle Adair, Karen Atkinson, Lara Bank, Ama Birch, Cindy Bravo, Bernard Brunon, Michael Buitron, John Burtle, Audrey Chan, Caroline Chang, Carolyn Chen, Andrew Clinco, Samantha Cohen, John D'Amico, David Dominguez, Ken Ehrlich, Daiana Feuer, Matthew Fielder, Flint, Robert Frashure, Nancy Ganucheau, Cary Georges, Mary Beth Heffernan, D Jean Hester, Julia Holter and the Open Academy Youth Orchestra at LATTC, Alexis Hudgins, Sarah Ibraham, Islands of LA, Katie Jacobson, Ian James, Kyoung Kim, Shaun Klaseus, Sojung Kwon, Andrea Lambert, Emery Martin, Anita K.
